# BirthdayDiscordBot
It is a birthday bot written in Java for the discord chat server. 

The bot works on Discord with minimum funcitonality. The aim for the final product is that the bot is able to store everyone's birthday, remind the grou about upcoming birthday's, allow users to search for someone's birthday, and print the sorted list of birthdays when promted. 

It uses the JDA (Java Discord API) which provides a full wrapping of the Discord REST api and its Websocket-Events for Java. The link for the same is https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA
